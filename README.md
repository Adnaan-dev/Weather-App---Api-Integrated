## 🛠️ Key Technologies Used

- **CSS** – To style the UI and make it responsive.
- **JavaScript** – To fetch and dynamically display weather data.
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – Provides real-time weather data.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users enter a **city name** in the search box.
2. The app sends a request to the **OpenWeatherMap API** using the city name.
3. The API returns the current weather data for that city.
4. The weather info is displayed in a clean and user-friendly UI.

## 💡 Implementation Details

- **Fetch API**: JavaScript’s `fetch()` method is used to make API requests.
- **API Key**: A free API key from OpenWeatherMap is required to authenticate requests. *(You can register on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get your own key).*
